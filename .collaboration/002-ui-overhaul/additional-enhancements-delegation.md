Looking at the current state, I can see the design is mostly working but needs targeted refinements. Let me check the repo structure first, then provide specific task assignments.Perfect! I can see the organized structure with proper collaboration docs. Based on your current state and requirements, here are two targeted task assignments for parallel work:

# Task Assignment: Targeted Bridge Interface Refinements

## **Agent 1: GitHub Copilot** - T01-Mobile-Responsive-Polish

### **Scope:** Mobile responsiveness and spacing refinements
**Files to modify:**
- `blog/_sass/_layout.scss` (existing)
- `blog/_sass/_components.scss` (sections: value-props, spacing utilities)

### **Specific Tasks:**

**T01.1: Mobile Value Props Grid**
- Fix value props responsiveness on narrow screens
- Current: 3-column grid breaks poorly on mobile
- Target: Single column below 640px, better padding/margins
- Update `.value-props` media queries for cozy mobile experience

**T01.2: Spacing Optimization**
- Reduce excessive whitespace throughout
- Tighten section margins (`--space-4xl` → `--space-3xl` where appropriate)
- Optimize container padding for mobile (`--space-lg` → `--space-md` on small screens)
- Adjust hero section vertical spacing

**T01.3: Typography Scale Refinement**
- Review mobile font sizes (too large on small screens)
- Optimize line heights for reading comfort
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy spacing

**Deliverables:**
- Responsive value props component
- Tighter overall spacing system
- Mobile-optimized typography
- Testing on 320px, 768px, 1024px viewports

## **Agent 2: Claude Code** - T02-Color-System-Unification

### **Scope:** Create unified color system and eliminate harsh contrasts
**Files to modify:**
- `blog/_sass/_tokens.scss` (primary focus)
- `blog/_sass/_components.scss` (button state verification only)

### **Specific Tasks:**

**T02.1: Create Shared Color Manifest**
- Consolidate all color definitions in `_tokens.scss`
- Remove pure white (`#ffffff`) and pure black (`#000000`) throughout
- Create "medium" light mode (use slate 50/100 instead of white)
- Ensure consistent dark mode (no pure black, use slate 900/800)

**T02.2: Button State Matrix Validation**
- Verify all 8 button state combinations work correctly
- Light mode primary: White text on purple background
- Dark mode primary: Dark text on light purple background
- All secondary button states properly contrasted
- Test hover/focus states

**T02.3: Typography Segregation**
- Ensure button classes (`.btn`, `.button`) are properly excluded from link styling
- Verify no CSS cascade conflicts between typography and components
- Clean separation of concerns

**Deliverables:**
- Single source of truth for all colors
- No pure white/black anywhere in the system
- Verified button contrast ratios
- Clean typography/component separation

## **Coordination Protocol:**

### **File Conflicts Prevention:**
- **Copilot:** Focus on `_layout.scss` and layout-related sections of `_components.scss`
- **Claude Code:** Focus on `_tokens.scss` and color-related sections of `_components.scss`
- Both agents should commit frequently with descriptive messages

### **Git Workflow:**
```bash
# Each agent creates own branch
git checkout -b T01-mobile-responsive-polish  # Copilot
git checkout -b T02-color-system-unification  # Claude Code

# Work independently, commit frequently
git add . && git commit -m "T01.1: Fix value props mobile grid"
git add . && git commit -m "T02.1: Create shared color manifest"

# When complete, merge back to main
```

### **Testing Requirements:**
- **Copilot:** Test responsive behavior at multiple screen sizes
- **Claude Code:** Test light/dark mode toggle, verify button contrast
- Both: Ensure Jekyll builds without errors (`bundle exec jekyll serve`)

### **Success Criteria:**
1. **Mobile responsiveness improved** (value props work on narrow screens)
2. **No pure white/black colors** in either theme
3. **Tighter, cozier spacing** throughout
4. **All button states properly contrasted**
5. **Clean color system architecture**

The tasks are designed to be completely independent - Copilot handles layout/responsive issues while Claude Code handles the color system, with minimal file overlap.
