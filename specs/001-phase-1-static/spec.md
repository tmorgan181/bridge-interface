# Feature Specification: Phase 1 Static Jekyll Blog

**Feature Branch**: `001-phase-1-static`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Phase 1 static Jekyll blog with design system foundations, accessible content hub for AI research, and future-proof architecture for Phase 2-4 evolution

---

## Overview

The Bridge Phase 1 establishes a public-facing static blog that serves as an accessible interface to The Atrium research facility. While technically simple (Jekyll-based static site), it is architected with future growth in mind: interactive demos (Phase 2), API integration (Phase 3), and authenticated portal features (Phase 4).

**Mission Alignment**: Make AI conversation research accessible, practical, and honest for "ordinary folks" - bridging the gap between AI hype and dismissiveness.

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**As a** visitor interested in AI conversation research  
**I want to** read accessible explanations and real examples from The Atrium  
**So that** I can understand practical AI collaboration patterns without gatekeeping jargon

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a visitor arrives at the home page, **When** they view the site, **Then** they see a clear introduction to The Bridge and can navigate to blog posts, about page, and Atrium overview
2. **Given** a visitor wants to read content, **When** they access the site on mobile or desktop, **Then** the layout adapts responsively and remains readable without JavaScript
3. **Given** a visitor browses blog posts, **When** they view the posts index, **Then** they see all published posts in reverse chronological order with clear titles and dates
4. **Given** a visitor reads a blog post, **When** they view the post, **Then** the content is presented with accessible typography, proper semantic HTML, and meets WCAG AA standards
5. **Given** future phases will add features, **When** Phase 1 is complete, **Then** the URL structure, design tokens, and component patterns are stable and extensible

### Edge Cases

- What happens when JavaScript is disabled? → Core content must remain fully functional
- What happens when viewing on slow connections? → Site must load quickly with minimal dependencies
- How does the site handle screen readers? → Semantic HTML and proper ARIA labels ensure accessibility
- What happens when migrating to Phase 2/3? → URL structure remains stable, components are designed for portability

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Design System**
- **FR-010**: Site MUST implement a consistent design system with defined tokens for colors, typography, spacing
- **FR-011**: Design tokens MUST be defined separately from implementation to enable future framework migration

- **FR-013**: Components MUST be structured to map cleanly to future React/Vue components

**Accessibility & Performance**
- **FR-014**: Site MUST meet WCAG AA accessibility standards minimum
- **FR-015**: Site MUST use semantic HTML throughout (proper headings, landmarks, alt text)
- **FR-016**: Site MUST be fully functional without JavaScript (progressive enhancement)
- **FR-017**: Site MUST be mobile-responsive with mobile-first design approach
- **FR-018**: Site MUST load quickly even on slow connections (optimized assets, minimal dependencies)

**Future-Proofing**
- **FR-019**: URL structure MUST remain stable across Phase 1-4 evolution
- **FR-020**: Reserved URL paths MUST be documented for future features (`/demos/`, `/api/`, `/portal/`, `/explore/`)
- **FR-021**: Component architecture MUST support migration to component-based frameworks (React/Vue/Next.js)
- **FR-022**: Design system tokens MUST be portable to future frontend frameworks

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**
- **NFR-001**: Initial page load MUST complete in under 2 seconds on 3G connection
- **NFR-002**: Lighthouse performance score MUST be 90+ for all pages

**Accessibility**
- **NFR-003**: WCAG AA compliance MUST be verified with automated and manual testing
- **NFR-004**: Keyboard navigation MUST work for all interactive elements
- **NFR-005**: Color contrast ratios MUST meet WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)

**Maintainability**
- **NFR-006**: Content updates (blog posts) MUST require zero code changes
- **NFR-007**: Design system changes MUST be centralized in token definitions
- **NFR-008**: Template structure MUST be well-documented for future contributors

**Scalability**
- **NFR-009**: Architecture MUST support progressive enhancement to interactive demos (Phase 2)
- **NFR-010**: URL structure MUST accommodate future API routes without breaking changes

### Key Entities

**Blog Post**
- Represents individual content pieces about AI research
- Attributes: title, date, author, slug, content (markdown), tags, status (draft/published)
- Stored as markdown files in `_posts/` directory
- Relationships: Can be tagged, authored, categorized

**Static Page**
- Represents permanent informational pages (About, Atrium overview)
- Attributes: title, slug, content (markdown), layout template
- Stored as markdown/HTML files in root or designated directories

**Design Token**
- Represents reusable design values (colors, typography scales, spacing)
- Attributes: token name, value, category (color/typography/spacing/etc), usage context
- Defined in centralized location (CSS custom properties or SCSS variables)
- Designed for future extraction to JSON/JS format

**Template Component**
- Represents reusable UI patterns (navigation, footer, post card, page header)
- Attributes: component name, props/parameters, layout structure
- Implemented as Jekyll includes
- Designed to map to future React/Vue components

## Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope (Phase 1)
✅ Static Jekyll site generation  
✅ Markdown blog posts  
✅ Static pages (Home, About, Atrium)  
✅ Design system foundations  
✅ Responsive, accessible layouts  
✅ Basic navigation  
✅ Component-based templates (Jekyll includes)  
✅ Future-proof URL structure  

### Out of Scope (Future Phases)
❌ Backend/API (Phase 3)  
❌ Interactive demos (Phase 2)  
❌ Authentication/user accounts (Phase 4)  
❌ Dynamic rendering (Phase 3+)  
❌ Database/data persistence beyond static files  
❌ Search functionality (Phase 2+)  
❌ Comments system (Phase 2+)  

### Dependencies
- Jekyll static site generator (external tool)
- GitHub Pages or Netlify for hosting (external service)
- Markdown format for content (standard)

### Assumptions
- Content will be authored in markdown by maintainers (no CMS needed in Phase 1)
- Hosting will be on GitHub Pages or similar static hosting service
- Site traffic will be modest in Phase 1 (no CDN optimization required yet)
- Design system can evolve iteratively as content needs emerge

9. ✅ Component templates are modular and documented
10. ✅ Performance metrics meet targets (Lighthouse 90+, <2s load time)
