## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
**As a** visitor to The Bridge  
**I want** to choose between light and dark visual themes  
**So that** I can read content comfortably in my preferred environment while experiencing a cohesive visual connection to The Atrium

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new visitor arrives at The Bridge  
   **When** they view the site  
   **Then** the site displays in their system's preferred color scheme (light or dark)

2. **Given** a visitor prefers a different theme than their system default  
   **When** they click the theme toggle button  
   **Then** the entire site instantly switches between light and dark mode, and their preference is remembered for future visits

3. **Given** a visitor is reading in light mode  
   **When** they view content  
   **Then** text is displayed on clean white backgrounds with professional gray accents and subtle purple hints connecting to Atrium

4. **Given** a visitor is reading in dark mode  
   **When** they view content  
   **Then** text is displayed on dark slate backgrounds (lighter than Atrium's navy) with prominent purple/blue glowing accents

5. **Given** a visitor encounters Atrium-related content (links, preview cards)  
   **When** they view these elements in either mode  
   **Then** Atrium elements use consistent purple (#a78bfa) branding and distinctive dark styling that stands out appropriately

6. **Given** a visitor navigates between pages  
   **When** the page loads  
   **Then** their theme preference persists without flickering or flash of wrong theme

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user has custom browser high-contrast mode enabled?
- How does the theme toggle behave if JavaScript is disabled?
- What if a user's system preference changes while browsing the site?
- How do code blocks with syntax highlighting adapt between themes?

## Requirements

### Visual Design System

**Theme Modes**
- **FR-001**: Site MUST support two distinct color themes: light mode (default) and dark mode

- **FR-054**: Design tokens MUST be organized by category: colors, typography, spacing, layout, effects, transitions
- **FR-055**: Theme-specific tokens MUST be scoped to [data-theme="light"] and [data-theme="dark"] attributes
- **FR-056**: Atrium signature colors MUST be defined at root level (theme-independent)
- **FR-057**: Component styles MUST reference design tokens, never hard-coded values
- **FR-058**: Design system MUST support future Phase 2 interactive demos without breaking changes

### Key Entities

**Theme State**
- Represents: Current color mode (light or dark)
- Attributes: Active theme name, user preference vs system default, transition state
- Storage: Browser localStorage for persistence
- Relationships: Controls all theme-specific design tokens

**Design Tokens**
- Represents: Centralized visual design decisions
- Categories: Backgrounds, text colors, borders, accents, shadows, typography, spacing, layout, transitions
- Variants: Theme-specific (light/dark) vs theme-independent (Atrium colors, typography, spacing)
- Relationships: Referenced by all component styles

**Atrium Brand Identity**
- Represents: Visual connection between Bridge and Atrium
- Attributes: Signature colors (purple #a78bfa, blue #60a5fa), navy/indigo gradients, glow effects
- Consistency: Same across both Bridge themes and future Atrium portal
- Relationships: Used in navigation links, preview cards, buttons, accents

**Component Styles**
- Represents: Reusable UI element appearances
- Examples: Header, navigation, post cards, buttons, code blocks, Atrium preview cards
- States: Default, hover, focus, active
- Relationships: Built using design tokens, adapts automatically to theme changes
